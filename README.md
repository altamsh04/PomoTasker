Pomotasker is a productivity tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, a renowned time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking your work into focused intervals, known as "pomodoros," lasting 25 minutes each, followed by a brief 5-minute break. After completing four consecutive pomodoros, a more extended break of 15 to 30 minutes is recommended. Pomotasker introduces additional features to enhance your work experience.
